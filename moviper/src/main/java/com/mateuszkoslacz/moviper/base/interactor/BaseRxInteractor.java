 * Base Interactor class. (see {@link ViperInteractor})
 * <p/>
 * It's responsible for manipulating data on behalf of presenter, ie. saving data to db, getting
 * data from remotes etc.
 * <p/>
 * It has no Presenter reference as it should return Observables to asynchronously pass data to
 * Presenter. If you are looking for solution adopted to regular, non-Rx approach, see {@link
 * BaseRxInteractor}.
