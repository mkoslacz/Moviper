 * It's responsible for performing all platform-specific tasks in behalf of presenter, ie. starting
 * a new Activity, a new Service, scheduling alarms etc.
 * <p>
 * It's also responsible of UI changes outside of given view, ie. Fragment presenter uses this
 * routing for switching Fragments in parent Activity.
 * <p>
 * In complex use cases you will probably want to include here separate classes for handling alarms
 * scheduling, Services creating etc. for better separation of concepts.
 * <p>
 * If you are looking for solution providing Android Views to use in Android Transaction with shared
 * views, see {@link MoviperViewHelperRouting}
